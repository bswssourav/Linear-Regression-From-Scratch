For each of the part, I have created separate source file. 
I have wrote all the source file in python programming language.

Each of my source code file writing generated data in a 'Excel' file and reading from 'Excel'file for further purpose.
    Example:
	dataxl.save("C:\\Users\\Sourav Biswas\\Desktop\\sampleData.xls")  \\please change the path
	pd.read_excel("C:\\Users\\Sourav Biswas\\Desktop\\sampleData.xls","sheet 1") \\please change the path
	
For reading, writing in to a Excel file, I have setted path of my Desktop. So, for running all these source code one must need to change
the path of his/her computer. 

I have import below packages in my source code:
    numpy, pandas, xlwt, xlrd, matplotlib.pyplot

One must install all these packages before running all my source code.
